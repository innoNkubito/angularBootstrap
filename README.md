# angularBootstrap
#A simple Angular JS app styled using Bootstrap

1. Still working on utilizing $http with a custom service to fetch json file from a database.

2. For now I'm doing an ajax call from the controller to fetch the json file.(Bad practice but it works)

3. To run this project; you'll need to install a node js server if you are using sublime text. It runs on HTTP port 3000.
