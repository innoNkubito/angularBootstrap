# angularBootstrap
A simple Angular JS app styled using Bootstrap
#Still working on utilizing $http with a custom service to fetch json file from a database

#For now I'm doing an ajax call to fetch the json file from the controller (Bad practice but it works)

#To run this project; you'll need to install a node js server if you are using sublime text. It runs on HTTP port 3000
