# angularBootstrap
#A simple Angular JS app styled using Bootstrap

1. To run this project; you'll need to install a node js server if you are using sublime text. It runs on HTTP port 3000.(See server.js)

2. Still working on utilizing $http with a custom service/factory to fetch json file from a database.

3. For now I'm doing an ajax call from the controller to fetch the json file.(Bad practice but it works)

4.  Edit button functionality not implemented yet.
